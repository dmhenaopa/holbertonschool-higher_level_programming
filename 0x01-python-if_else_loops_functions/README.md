+ 6-print_comb3.py: This program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers are separated by comma, followed by a space. The two digits are different and print only the smallest combination of two digits. Numbers be printed in ascending order, with two digits. The last number be followed by a new line.
+ 7-islower.py: This program have a function that checks for lowercase character. Returns True if c is lowercase or False otherwise.
+ 8-uppercase.py: Function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
+ 9-print_last_digit.py: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
+ 10-add.py: Function that adds two integers and returns the result.
+ 11-pow.py: A function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
+ 12-fizzbuzz.py: A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
+ 100-print_tebahpla.py: A program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase), not followed by a new line.
