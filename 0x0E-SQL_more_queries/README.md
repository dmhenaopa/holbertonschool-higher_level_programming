## :pencil2:  SQL - More queries

This folder contains some scripts to use the open source database management software MySQL. Here we found commands to create a new user, grant privileges, create tables with some characteristics as NOT NULL, DEFAULT value, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY,  AUTO_INCREMENT. Additionaly, the use of the key

### Requirements:
All commands were tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Although the commands might work fine on other distributions, versions or operative systems.

Additionally, MySQL database management software was used. The version of MySQL: 14.14 Distrib 5.5.62, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 6.3.

If you don't have MySQL installed, download it and install as shown (Ubuntu):

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server

### Usage:
You need to execute as follows:

    cat file.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p

Some of the files additionally require that you pass the name of the database with which you want to work or that you want to modify. In these cases the execution will be like this:

    cat file.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p mydatabase

### Executable files:

+ 2-create_read_user.sql: Script that creates the database hbtn_0d_2 and the user user_0d_2. user_0d_2 should have only SELECT privilege in the database hbtn_0d_2. The user_0d_2 password should be set to user_0d_2_pwd. If the database hbtn_0d_2 already exists, your script should not fail. If the user user_0d_2 already exists, your script should not fail.
+ 3-force_name.sql: Script that creates the table force_name on your MySQL server. force_name description: id INT, name VARCHAR(256) can’t be null. The database name will be passed as an argument of the mysql command. If the table force_name already exists, your script should not fail.
