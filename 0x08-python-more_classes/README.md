Public instance method: def perimeter(self): that returns the rectangle perimeter. print() and str() should print the rectangle with the character #. repr() should return a string representation of the rectangle to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval(). Print the message Bye rectangle... (... being 3 dots not ellipsis) when an instance of Rectangle is deleted. Public class attribute number_of_instances initialized to 0. Incremented during each new instance instantiation. Decremented during each instance deletion.
