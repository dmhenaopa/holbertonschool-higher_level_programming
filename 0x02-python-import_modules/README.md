## :pencil2: Python - import and modules
This folder contains some useful Python scripts with programs and on what is a module, how can this module be imported, how can be imported the variables of this module and specific functions. Also, the use of div() function and sys standard module.   

### Requirements:
All commands were tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Although the commands might work well on other distributions, versions or operative systems. The Python linter was PEP8, and the version of Python was Python 3.4.3. 

### Usage:
Verify that the files have execution permissions before being used! **If not, use the following command:**

    chmod u+x name_of_file ###To make the file executable

For the Python scripts, the way to execute them is by putting a period and a slash before the command name. As follows:

    ./name_of_file ###To execute the file

### Executable files:
Here a short description of each script:
+ [0-add.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-python-import_modules/0-add.py): A program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3.
+ [1-calculation.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-python-import_modules/1-calculation.py): A program that imports functions from the file [*calculator_1.py*](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-python-import_modules/calculator_1.py), does some maths, and prints the result.
+ [2-args.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-python-import_modules/2-args.py): A program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments. The output is the number of arguments followed by one line per argument.
+ [3-infinite_add.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-python-import_modules/3-infinite_add.py): A program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments.
+ [4-hidden_discovery.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-python-import_modules/4-hidden_discovery.py): Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc.
+ [5-variable_load.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-python-import_modules/5-variable_load.py): A program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.
+ [100-my_calculator.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-python-import_modules/100-my_calculator.py): A program that imports all functions from the file [*calculator_1.py*](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-python-import_modules/calculator_1.py) and handles basic operations.
