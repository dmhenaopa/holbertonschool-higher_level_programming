## :pencil2: Python - Hello World!
This folder contains some useful scripts with basic Python and Python-related shell commands to run python scripts or code. Also, programs to print string, integer, float, and to obtain substrings or to concatenate strings. Finally, 

### Requirements:
All commands were tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Although the commands might work well on other distributions, versions or operative systems.

### Usage:
Verify that the files have execution permissions before being used! **If not, use the following command:**

    chmod u+x name_of_file ###To make the file executable

In all cases, all files, the way to execute them is by putting a period and a slash before the command name. As follows:

    ./name_of_file ###To execute the file

### Executable files:
