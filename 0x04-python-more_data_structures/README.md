## :pencil2: Python - More data structures
This folder contains some useful scripts with basic Python about the use of tuples, lists, sets and dictionaries. We use some functions like sort(), append(), copy(), items(), key(), value(). We learn how to traverse a dictionary and a list. How to obtain values and keys in dictionaries or only values in lists and how to operate this values.

### Requirements:
All commands were tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Although the commands might work well on other distributions, versions or operative systems. The Python linter was PEP8, and the version of Python was Python 3.4.3. 

### Usage:
Verify that the files have execution permissions before being used! **If not, use the following command:**

    chmod u+x name_of_file ###To make the file executable

For the shell and Python scripts, the way to execute them is by putting a period and a slash before the command name. As follows:

    ./name_of_file ###To execute the file

### Executable files:

Here a short description of each script:
+ [0-square_matrix_simple.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-python-more_data_structures/0-square_matrix_simple.py): A function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
+ [1-search_replace.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-python-more_data_structures/1-search_replace.py): A function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
+ [2-uniq_add.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-python-more_data_structures/2-uniq_add.py): A function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
+ [3-common_elements.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-python-more_data_structures/3-common_elements.py): A function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
+ [4-only_diff_elements.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-python-more_data_structures/4-only_diff_elements.py): A function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
+ [5-number_keys.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-python-more_data_structures/5-number_keys.py): A function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
+ [6-print_sorted_dictionary.py](https://github.com/dmhenaopa/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x04-python-more_data_structures/6-print_sorted_dictionary.py): A function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
+ 7-update_dictionary.py: A function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
+ 8-simple_delete.py: A function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
+ 9-multiply_by_2.py: A function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
+ 10-best_score.py: A function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
+ 11-multiply_list_map.py: Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops. Returns a new list: Same length as my_list and each value should be multiplied by number.
+ 100-weight_average.py: Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>)
+ 102-complex_delete.py: A function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
